# Agents vs Operatives

Agents VS Operatives was a 2008 attempt at creating a Facebook game, back when those were a thing you could build and make some money from.  Project AVO, as it was known internally at Polycot, didn't get far beyond the prototype phase, but the ideas we had might be of use to someone else, so here they are, with a Creative Commons license.
